## Making Gradients with JS

This project involved writing a function that would create a gradient square. The concept was to be able to programmatically generate a square that would house a certain number of other squares, each one smaller and slightly lighter than the last.

The function accepts two parameters: how dark you want the largest square to be in RGB terms, and how wide you want the visible space of each square to be.

## To Do!

* Allow the user to select their own parameters
* Tie box generation to a button

## Maybe To Do!

* Refactor so two different colors can be input as parameters, and the number of steps to go from one color to the other, as well
